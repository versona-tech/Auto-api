# **App Name**: AutoAPI

## Core Features:

- Code Parsing: Parse JavaScript/TypeScript code to extract API endpoint details from code comments.
- Swagger Doc Generation: Generate interactive API documentation in Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 format.
- Postman Collection Export: Export API test collections in JSON format, compatible with Postman.
- CLI Interface: Provide a command-line interface for running the documentation generator.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness, reminiscent of developer tools.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a neutral backdrop that ensures readability and focuses attention on the documentation content. It harmonizes well with the deep blue, creating a balanced contrast that reduces eye strain and enhances visual clarity for users interacting with the API documentation.
- Accent color: Teal (#00BCD4) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. It adds a pop of color to guide the user's attention to interactive or important areas.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern, machined look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use a clean, modular layout with clear sections for each API endpoint. Utilize spacing and alignment to guide the user through the documentation in a logical manner.
- Subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements to enhance the user experience, such as highlighting code snippets or expanding documentation sections. Ensure animations are smooth and do not distract from the content.
